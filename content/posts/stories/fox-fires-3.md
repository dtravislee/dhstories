It was most of the day after they uncurled from each other, broke their sleeping fast, repackaged the intricate simplicity of their tent into their sled, and rebound every single item in its meticulous place that they came upon the door. 

From a distance, and aside from its position in the middle of a snowy landscape, it looked to be an ordinary, oak door. Six decorative rectangles set in the door reached from the top to the bottom in two columns of three each. Chiselled slopes surrounded each rectangle, digging deep into the door from the rectangle's edge to form small valleys about each square. The door's handle, set toward the right edge, was a simple lever with a wavy design and a tapered end. Like a snake sealed in brass. The lower right corner of the doorway dipped into the snow, setting the entire entryway askew. Around it sat an open expanse of snow, a blanket of painter's canvas stretching as far and as flat and as untarnished by trees or shrubs or cliffs or hills as the pair could see. Bright clouds belonging to the mid-day sky dipped below the tundra's horizon like a flock of migrating angels.

It was as Tamilla and Antias came within only a dozen metres that they noticed the other, stranger parts of the door. The doorway in which it was set looked like cracked-off concrete. When Antias had first encountered such a door during their excursion several years ago, he remarked that it looked like it had been broken off, as if someone chiselled it from the side of a building with no care for smooth contours or regular geometry, and set in the middle of the desert. No matter how far he had walked around the structure, it seemed to turn to face him at every step. 

This time, he was aware of the way the concrete bled into the air with uncertain, blurry edges. It was not broken off, he realized. It was as if the air itself was glass that had been shattered. He could see how, with each step toward the door, the jagged walls stretched around them on all sides. How the sky disappeared into a roof stretching far above their heads. How the snow beneath their feet gave way to a cold, stone floor. How like stepping into a painting it was, unreal yet real. How the smell of a dark, damp cave crawled into their noses like tiny spiders. They discarded the sled at the snow's edge, packed their snowshoes against the green tarp of their supplies, and treaded forth with trepidation. Little more than the soft sounds of their footfalls on the smooth floor greeted their ears. Even the wind had fled the unnatural place and taken the sound of their breaths with them. Without the stress of pulling their sled or maintaining their attire against a biting cold, the quiet became uncomfortable for them both.

"Why are you walking so slow?" Tamilla asked from behind her partner. She slid alongside him, the hallway more than wide enough for them to walk shoulder to shoulder.

"It always scares me how things here feel so—unnatural," Antias said.

Tamilla nudged against her partner. "Speaks the botanist," she said.

"And so speaks the engineer!" He returned her playful bump with a shared chortle between the two.

"Why wouldn't I? It's fascinating, how they did all this. How they could curve the air around like that—"

"You talk as if you have any idea what any of these places are."

"And you talk as if the unknown is always some frightening thing!"

Their banter fell as silent as the air after a half-minute of creeping down the hallway. The door was taller than it appeared mere moments ago. Tamilla stretched and only just touched the curved, brass handle. She found friction enough to find purchase. She tugged the lever downward in practiced routine. 

Antias shoved the wooden slab ajar with his shoulder, enough to snake around. Like the other doors, it was lighter than he thought a door that size made of wood had any right to be. Perhaps, he thought, it was hollow. Or not true wood. The aged and worn hinges creaked as the pins and screws within whined and rust ground against rust like an ancient motor. Sunlight from the hallway behind them cast their shadows upon the door, slipped past Antias to tickle the darkness on the other side. While Tamilla kept the door ajar, Antias crept through the gap. For but a moment, the inky blackness swallowed him en route to retrieve a small boulder and wedge it between the door and the frame.

"Come on," Antias said as Tamilla let the door rest against the rock. It held steady, the stone shifting even as she set a foot upon it to rock it to and fro. In the growing dark, they reached to the shoulders of their winter jackets and touched round, crystalline bulbs jailed against their bodies with steel wires as cell bars. Metal caps held the glass in place above and below. Antias and Tamilla found the rollers and buttons set into the bottom caps, a simple horizontal tumbler they flicked and a button the pressed shortly thereafter to feed fuel to the bulb. Sparks leapt within the confines of the bulb and, after several tries, their coat-mounted torches lit aflame. It took only a nudge of the button to lock it in place and keep the fires lit by a steady spittle of fuel.

The opposite side of the door was unlike the inside of any building Antias or Tamilla knew from their hometown. What had been a hallway wide enough to fit five of them narrowed within a handful of strides to a route wide enough to fit them both—but only just. Smooth as the top surface was, the edges of the pathway were worn and jagged and looked ready to crumble more at a moment's notice. Antias imagined rocks tumbling down the sides of the route, but as he peered over the edge and shone his light toward the centre of the earth, he saw only a sheer cliff devoured by the void an infinite distance below. It was black enough that he expected to see stars. The surrounding walls lay no nearer, Tamilla discovered, her lamp light swallowed by the same dark that inhabited the air below. Only the ceiling above gave a sense of distance, the rock split apart to show the brilliant, sparkling sprinkle of stars overhead. In the darkened, infinite cavern, the stellar pin-pricks provided just a salting of light to help their torches show the way.

The room felt like a canyon inverted, a tiny line of rock cleaving empty air in twain. To Tamilla, it was as if the ceiling itself had fallen in and created the one path forward.

"I thought it was mid-day," Tamilla pondered aloud. Antias flipped his timepiece over his eyes again.

"It is," he said.

Guided by their lanterns, the pair crept along the path in single file. The narrow, serpentine walkway broadened further, four shoulder-widths wide, and lifted upwards in a set of stairs. They began to climb with Antias still leading the way. Smooth slopes decorated either side of the stairwell, playing host to several metallic staves shoved into the stone that Tamilla guessed once housed lanterns of their own. All that remained of the cavern's lighting, she could see, were small, blackened pyramids atop each square pole. Whatever once laid atop the rods had been taken, whether by thieves or by nature.

When Antias reached the top of the stairwell, a light of silver and gold sparkled in his eyes like the moon had fallen into the cave. He paused and shaded his light to block most of the glare. A silver pedestal, one shaped like a pyramid with its upper half sheared from its base, sat upon the stony plateau. From the pedestal jutted a straight, silver stick, a sharp ridge striking from where it joined the stone to the top. At the upper end of the sharpened rod stretched two limbs to either side, thin yet sturdy and stiff, splaying out in quiet pride. A handle wrapped in black cord stretched even further upward and held a bulbous, metal disk far above what even Tamilla might ever hope to reach. It was a jewel within, a hexagonal ruby larger than Antias had yet seen, one that drew him closer and closer to the pedestal.

"Don't touch it!" Tamilla called out behind him. Antias almost leapt away from the silver blade.

"What is it?"

"A sword, I think. The old texts say our ancestors used them to cleave their kin in two. They say that they made swords to burn cities from the sky with fiery explosions, or raze the stars themselves."

"And you believe it?" Antias asked.

"I mean," Tamilla said, "I'm not sure."

Antias slid away from the sword and settled beside his partner. Together, they pondered the creators of the weapon before them. They wondered if the legends written about these knives were true. They wondered how their ancestors could condone such creations. They wondered how any living thing could ever wield such large, monstrous blades in their jaws. How else, they debated, could such weapons be used by four-legged creatures like them?

And why did they need to?

An hour of talk gave way to silence once more. There were no drips of water falling from invisible stalactites. No rocks crumbled and fell from the path behind them. The only sounds came from their lungs, then from the gentle rustling of their clothes. Together, the two foxes, Antias and Tamilla, disrobed again. Not entirely did they discard their clothes, but enough for the triangular peaks atop their heads to wiggle and move in newfound freedom. A small, brief tickle of whiskers gave quiet thanks to the other for their help. They sat upon their haunches in the middle of the alien cave and looked through the cracked gap above. Their paintbrush tails coiled about one another into a marbled mix of copper, brown, black, and white. Unanswered questions disappeared from their minds. Still and quiet, they watched the aurora's rainbow curtains dance across the night sky.
