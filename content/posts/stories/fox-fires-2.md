Their sled was a small affair, little more than a plank of wood and two metal skis that could glide over snow and ice alike. It was hardly a hair's width wider than Antias, but was long and tall. Around each of the forward curls of the sled's skis coiled a single rope, broad and thick and woven through one leather harness that, moments prior, had been about Tamilla's shoulders. Every so often, the two traded pulling their goods along, one wiggling out of straps to work them about the other. A green tarp covered the mobile contraption, tightened to its payload with various strings and ropes that wove about the sled in a chessboard pattern missing its pieces. 

It was all tight enough that Antias and Tamilla could count every single box just by the cliffs they formed in their mountain of manufactured miscellany. Some held food. Some held blankets with checkered patterns not unlike the ones the ropes made. One ferried several books, a rainbow of hard covers intended to pass the time were they ever snowed in and their progress halted.

One box was missing from the collection.

A grassy, glossy green tent ballooned with each press of Antias's foot on an accordion pedal. Each step billowed wind into a steel chimney. Air thrust into the pillowed walls of the tent. Tamilla watched the portable abode come to life, each gasping, artificial breath making it rise, fall, then rise higher. It was easily ten times the width of her body and grew just as tall, if not taller. A fern rising to meet a spring sun.

Every so often, in spite of her matted hair and dishevelled clothes, she scampered about the perimeter of the tent as best as she could. Within the tent's walls, hugged by the ballooning air, sat metal poles to be fit together and set in place and driven into the soil. Antias was not so long-limbed as to be able to reach them from the air pump.

Necessity drove Tamilla inside before her partner, her shoes abandoned outside with a juvenile kick of her feet. Her body sighed with the newfound warmth their tiny, yet hearty, furnace granted. The steel box heated the air within their tent and maintained a balmy insulation within the walls, sure to continue burning throughout the night. Setting a small stepladder in the middle, Tamilla reached toward the ceiling to fit the final pieces of the tent together. The poles, their personal Atlas of myth, would ferry the weight of the fabric when the warm air cooled and could no longer keep the mobile home from collapsing on them both. A faint scent of charcoal permeated the room, far different than the scentless snow outside.

The inside of the tent was spacious and simple. At the far end, against the bright emerald hues that coloured the inside of the abode, sat a single, green mattress inflated by the same air that coursed through the walls. It was dark and mossy like damp leaves. The furnace sat toward the right of the entrance, little more than a steel tube that poked through the bottom of the wall and dipped into the floor. The pipe led to a vent set just aside Tamilla's ladder, one on which their portable boiler might fit. It was their way to cook food without the large tanks of gasoline a proper house might hold.

By the time Tamilla finished the final screw, the pleasurable sigh that once greeted her body turned into hot, sweaty, wet gasps beneath layers fit for the outdoors. Antias had secured their sled of supplies to a seal in their tent, sitting opposite the furnace. The seal was a zippered doorway, bound to a tarp covering their sled with thick, metal clips and several layers of woollen insulation. Every part was made and fit just so that the pair might access their things without needing to bare the coldâ€”or drag their precious supplies into the heat to spoil. It was after he raised the zipper, opened their boxed meals, and began cooking that he turned to see his partner pulling at clothing that became only more tangled about her. Swears and grunts and growls of frustration laced her panting breaths as she failed to free herself from the whirlwind of clothing

"Antias!" Tamilla called out at last, giving up in her endeavour and letting her partner disrobe her. It was not the first time the other had taken up the task in their dozens of years on the mortal plane. Nor, she knew, would it be the last. 

Their town, a home that now lay weeks behind them, through snow and a balloon ride across an ocean, engraved partnership into its foundation. Tailors helped their clients test attire; clients helped their tailors keep strings and tapes in place. The elderly and the youthful crossed streets in pairs. Strangers at sweet shop lines asked one another what thoughts came with cocoa-covered soufflet. As night fell, the town burst alive, people climbing metal poles and lighting lanterns that hung in the sky like moons made of fire. Even criminals, those who might burst into homes by latern-light alone, worked in no fewer than pairs.

But not all partnerships were made equal.

Antias unwound Tamilla's scarf from about her neck and face. Like the first autumn leaf, the blood red fabric fell to the grassy green tarp beneath them. Atop it came the plush, deep blue of her jacket, then the woollen black of her leggings. Tamilla tugged away Antias's matching attire that collected into a separate pile as haphazard yet natural as its twin. 

It began as a simple act of cooperation, an act of the same instinct that flowed in their blood and the blood of their friends and relatives. The scent of charcoal faded. The smell of cooked noodles and vegetables boiling in their heated pot of water drifted around the tent in its place. Gentle pepper-pricks tickled their noses. The savoury texture of plant-based beef-and-chicken seasonings caressed their tongues. Bubbles from the pot popped like waves splashing upon a sandy shoreline. And nature, the same bare and barren nature that surrounded them and kept them weeks away from the place in which they grew up, pulled Antias and Tamilla closer until their bodies fell onto their bed and tangled together.
