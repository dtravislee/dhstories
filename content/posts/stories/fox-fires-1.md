Two strode through the woods, their shadows reaching across the empty snow to touch upon their sled. The air sat in a cold calm. Their wide, wicker snowshoes pressed into the tundra with hardly a gentle crackle of ice within. Teardrops formed in the powdery ground, connected by canyons carved by the tails of their shoes. They strode over the roots of trees and the dips and rises of the uneven permafrost inches below. Above floated slate grey clouds, bulbs and streaks and bumps brushed onto the canvas of the pale blue sky. Sunlight from the horizon peeked washed the edges of the heavenly marshmallows in gold.

Marshmallows floated in Tamilla's mind. They floated in a mug of hot cocoa, held in a grasp just as grateful as her self. She wished her mind was hot cocoa. Maybe it could dry the few flakes the dove from branches above and tangled themselves in her hair. 

Tamilla had been wrapped snug in a vermillion scarf and hood, her hair tucked within the warm confines to keep it dry through wind, rain, and snow. She had been wrapped up until the hour just past, where the heavy climb of a steeper hill had tousled every part of her body—her legs, her core, even her hair—until she looked as ragged as she felt. And she felt like a rug freshly beaten clean. At the time, she had thought little of it. The skies were clear and dropless. She had thought the scenery tranquil, lovely, blinks of her eyes like camera shutters that kept the picture of the landscape on the inside of her eyelids. But now, with overcast heavens, with snow tumbling from the trees, with her copper locks dripping and clinging like seaweed to her skin from flakes that melted in her hair, she saw the cold landscape through spiteful fires behind her eyes.

"I need to rest," Tamilla called to her partner, taking an uneven gasp after their hours of silent trekking. 

Her partner, Antias, turned with a penguin waddle to face her, drawing sloppy circles in the snow about him. His bright, orange eyes peeked at her through circular goggles whose brown leather straps hugged his face. Stray strands of black and white drifted over the goggles like frozen streams of salt and pepper. He tapped one side of the goggles to flip a golden dial down in front of his eye, watching and hearing it click its rhythmic beats away. One spindly arm spasmed with each click as if it was ready to flee its glassy confines. He was clever enough not to try walking backwards with their broad-soled shows. Not so clever as to warn Tamilla, who—while Antias was distracted with his timepiece—almost tripped to keep from running into the man.

"We have one twelfth of a day yet, Tam," Antias replied. He flipped the dial back from his bright blue eyes and almost jumped when the much closer, visibly worn, panting form of his partner popped into sight. Her eyes had narrowed to almost slits, her teeth bared, looking ready to shove him into the snow and bite his neck.

"If I don't fix my clothes, you'll have one short-armed me to carry in the sled!"
