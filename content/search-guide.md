## Ordering (Sort:)

If you would like to view oldest results first, add `sort:oldest` to your query.

## Regex Mode (//)

Regular search

Exact search (with quotation marks)

Fuzzy / "or" search (with square brackets) - matches at least one keyword or keyphrase in the set (formatted the same as regular search otherwise)

Wildcard (asterisk character) - matches exactly one word, used in exact searches

Negation (dash before word / phrase) - excludes results that have that keyphrase

Date (before: or after: or between:) - includes results before / after / between given dates
