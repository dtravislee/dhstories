LINK RENDER

Adds target=_blank to external links, plus rel=noopener for safety. Also adds an "external link" notice on-hover and provides a tooltip-on-hover for all external links, with or without a title, explaining they open in a new tab.

(Yes, this must be put in a separate file, as Hugo will render comments in \_markup as whitespace.)
