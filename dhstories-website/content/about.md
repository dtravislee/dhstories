## The Site

_Dragonhouse Stories_ is a digital villa containing a miscellany of works by D. Travis Lee. This includes poetry, essays, opinion pieces, and—of course—stories. 

The website is built using the [Hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io/). Its source code can be viewed [on Github](https://github.com/dtravislee/dhstories).

## The Author

D. Travis Lee is a creator of fiction, poetry, and similar works hailing from British Columbia, Canada. He is the main writer, editor, and webmaster of _Dragonhouse Stories_.

Prior to starting the Dragonhouse, he earned a Creative Writing bachelor's degree with Dean's Honours and published "Mara Satellite", "How to Reject Someone You Love", and "Lethargy" in [_pulpMAG_](https://www.pulpmag.ca/). As he recalls it, his passion for creative literature began with a high school writing contest:

> My teacher told me about it at the end of the day. The deadline was the next morning. I had, I would guess, eight hours. So I brainstormed on the walk home and wrote most of the way through the night. I don't know what part of that set me on a writer's path—the intensity of the short deadline or the first-place prize I won. Maybe both. But the second-place prize I won the next year set that route in stone.

Much of Lee's writing tends toward fantasy, science fiction, and abstract or surrealist poetry—or hybrids therein. He lists the likes of [Terry Pratchett](https://terrypratchett.com/); [Adrian Tschaikovsky](https://www.adriantchaikovsky.com/); [Alastair Reynolds](https://www.alastairreynolds.com/); [Sarah Jolley](https://jolleycomics.com/); [Sharon Lee and Steve Miller](https://korval.com/); and countless contrubitors to short-story anthologies as inspirations. Out of all the works found on his e-reader, anthologies are, by far, the most plentiful.

When not writing, Travis dabbles in web design, having built _Dragonhouse Stories_ as a challenge in user accessibility, minimalistic design, and file size restrictions[^1]. He can also be found browsing philosophy and science websites, watching videogame-related videos, or—when words won't suffice—taking his creativity to the voxel world of Minecraft.

If he was a dragon,[^2] he would hoard ideas, notions, dreams, and other abstractions. He finds duality, and dualistic concepts, the most fascinating. The best food with which to bribe him is chocolate-covered pretzels.[^3]

[^1]: His inability to draw contributed to this decision.
[^2]: He claims he is not one. His preference for the colour gold makes this dubious
[^3]: Cookies of most varieties are an acceptable substitute. Various other sweets may, also, suffice.
