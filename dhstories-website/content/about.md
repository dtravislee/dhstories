## The site

_Dragonhouse Stories_[^note dragonhouse] is a digital villa containing a miscellany of works by D. Travis Lee. This includes poetry, essays, opinion pieces, and—of course—stories. 

The website is built using the [Hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io/). Its source code can be viewed [on Github](https://github.com/dtravislee/dhstories).

[^note dragonhouse]: "The Dragonhouse" refers to a hyper-spatial plane causally disconnected from broader reality.

**D. Travis Lee** (they / them)—also known as **Ty'rea-us Kyr'atine Rha'dze**[^note pronun]—is a creator of fiction, poetry, and similar works hailing from British Columbia, Canada. They are the main writer, editor, and webmaster of _Dragonhouse Stories_, and a self-proclaimed expert on interdimensional travel, shapeshifting into human disguises, and scriptcrafting.[^note script]

[^note pronun]: Pronounced approximately as _tie-ray-uh-us keer-uh-teen rah-dze_.
[^note script]: Described as "the practice of making true that which is written."

Prior to starting the Dragonhouse, they earned a Creative Writing bachelor's degree with Dean's Honours and published "Mara Satellite", "How to Reject Someone You Love", and "Lethargy" in [_pulpMAG_](https://www.pulpmag.ca/). As they recall it, their passion for creative literature began with a high school writing contest:

> My teacher told me about it at the end of the day. The deadline was the next morning. I had, I would guess, eight hours. So I brainstormed on the walk home and wrote most of the way through the night. I don't know what part of that set me on a writer's path—the intensity of the short deadline or the first-place prize I won. Maybe both. But the second-place prize I won the next year set that route in stone.

Much of their writing tends toward fantasy, science fiction, and abstract or surrealist poetry—or hybrids therein. They list the likes of [Terry Pratchett](https://terrypratchett.com/); [Adrian Tschaikovsky](https://www.adriantchaikovsky.com/); [Alastair Reynolds](https://www.alastairreynolds.com/); [Sarah Jolley](https://jolleycomics.com/); [Sharon Lee and Steve Miller](https://korval.com/); and countless contrubitors to short-story anthologies as inspirations. Out of all the works found on their e-reader, anthologies are, by far, the most plentiful.

When not writing, they dabble in web design, having started _Dragonhouse Stories_ as a challenge in user accessibility and minimalistic design. They can also be found browsing literature in science, philosophy, and mythology, if not watching videos on swords, mathematics, or games.

### Other details

- They were diagnosed with high-functioning autism at an early age.
- They are a Gemini in the western zodiac and Monkey in the eastern—water sign, despite a strong distaste for swimming.
- Though not an artist, digital or otherwise, they are proud of a few works: [Arthimi](/sword.png/) and [Avolos](/lances.png/).
- If they were a dragon,[^Note 3] they would hoard ideas, notions, dreams, and other abstractions, with a particular penchant for dualism, mythology, and oddities like 'pataphysics.
- The best foods with which to bribe them are croutons. Cookies and pretzels, chocolate ones in particular, also work.
- Their preferred school of magic is conjuration, especially teleportation, even though they don't play table-top role-playing games.[^Note 5]
- While they tend to dislike the idea of disliking things, mushrooms on anything is a no-go.[^Note 6]

[^Note 3]: They claim not to be one. Their fascination with the colour gold, among other valuable metals and gemstones, makes this assertion dubious.
[^Note 5]: Their second-favourite is arcane-powered sub-nanotechnology with a fractal construction made of smaller versions of themselves _ad infinitum_.
[^Note 6]: Olives on pizza, too. Pineapple is acceptable, but in small amounts.
